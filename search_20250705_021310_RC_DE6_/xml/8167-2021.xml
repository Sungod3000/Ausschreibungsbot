with low sag (HTLS conductors) of the types ACSS, (Z)TACIR and ACPS/ACPR including conductor related fittings for all mentioned conductors. For simplification the related fittings are always included in the following when not explicitly excluded.</P><P>Tenderers may bid for pre-qualification for one or more of the three aforementioned conductor technologies.</P><P>The testing program for the HTLS conductors in terms of fulfilling clause III.1(9) l) of this contract notice is to be carried out in accordance with the available capacities (three test slots per technology) in a test environment still to be determined by the contracting entity at the premises of an independent testing institute. The costs of the testing program in that case are borne by the contracting entity. The conductors to be tested, including mounting and working materials as well as equipment, is to be supplied by the applicant.</P><P>The testing program includes testing of each conductor, the related fittings, laying equipment as well as the overall interaction within the entire conductor system.</P><P>The necessary installation works for the purposes of pre-qualification are to be carried out by the applicant on the testing institute’s premises.</P><P>The expected date to start the pre-qualification test program in the independent testing institute is 1 July 2021. Applicants are advised to submit their application therefor latest 28 February 2021.</P><P>For time and capacity reasons, the contracting entity is not at this time able to commission further testing program slots.</P><P>In the event of capacity not being available, applicants may perform the testing according to the testing program of the contracting entity themselves. Upon submitting an application for the pre-qualification system, applicants require to state whether (providing capacity is available) testing is to be carried out by the testing institute nominated by the contracting entity or by other testing institutes. The testing institute must proof to be in possession of an accreditation according DIN EN ISO/IEC 17025 for the tests according to DIN EN 50182 or comparable.</P><P>If the applicant uses another testing institute, the applicant must inform the contracting entity of all planned scheduled dates for testing until 30 June 2021. The exact date has to be announced 60 days before the testing date. The contracting entity reserves the right to be in attendance for any technical testing and may address requests queries directly to the testing institute with regard to the tests being conducted. Applicant require to nominate their testing institute, a contact person and to make reasonable efforts to allow the contracting entity to attend the technical tests comprising the testing program.</P><P>The conclusions from technical tests that an applicant carries out itself require to be duly and properly corroborated by test protocols issued by the before mentioned independent testing institute.</P><P>The negotiation stage (without further EU announcement), leading to a framework agreement for the prospective manufacture and supply of up to 4 000 kilometres of HTLS conductors, is scheduled to start in Q3 of 2022. The framework agreement to be concluded also contain call-off rights of the ELIA Group.</P><P>Only companies that satisfy the full qualification requirements by that time and are shortlisted as pre-qualified companies are called upon to tender bids. Applicant wishing to have testing carried out by another testing institute are therefore urged to submit their results without delay. A submission after 30 June 2022 is likely to be regularly late.</P></SHORT_DESCR><AC><AC_PROCUREMENT_DOC/></AC><INDEFINITE_DURATION/><NO_EU_PROGR_RELATED/></OBJECT_DESCR></OBJECT_CONTRACT><LEFTI><QUALIFICATION><CONDITIONS><P>(a) A self-declaration by the applicant that none of the exclusion criteria under § 123 and § 124 of the German Act against Restraints of Competition is of application.</P><P>(b) A self-declaration by the applicant of its willingness to comply with statutory minimum wage provisions and adhere to pay tariffs laid down by way of collective bargaining.</P><P>(c) Submission of financial statements.

Applicants that are not pre-qualified are informed of the reasons for that decision. If an application is rejected or the qualification is annulled, a new application can be submitted at the earliest 1 month after receipt of the rejection or annulment.</P></METHODS></QUALIFICATION><QUALIFICATION><CONDITIONS><P>Applicants require to enclose a fully completed applicant questionnaire signed by an authorised responsible.</P></CONDITIONS><METHODS><P>Pre-selection of test participants</P><P>The number of candidates to get their equipment tested in the premises of an independent testing institute chosen by the contracting entity is limited. For each of the three types of conductor technologies (ACSS, (Z)TACIR and ACPS/ACPR) a program of testing is planned. Considerations of capacity dictate that the number of applicants admitted to the testing program is unlikely to exceed three for one type of conductor. Should more applicants apply for a testing program than the testing institute engaged by the contracting entity can accommodate, a pre-selection of test participants will be made. For this purpose, the reference lists of the aforementioned conductor types are each assessed individually by the contracting entity with regard to the performance and suitability of each respective applicant with regard to pre-qualification and the planned contract for the supply of HTLS conductors in accordance with the following assessment criteria:</P></METHODS></QUALIFICATION><QUALIFICATION><CONDITIONS><P>The applicant questionnaire must furthermore include such details and assurances as are not otherwise expressly demanded in terms of the particulars, assurances and evidence referred to in the foregoing.</P></CONDITIONS><METHODS><P>Based on the information provided in columns 1 to 21 of the reference lists such as project description, place of performance, production time, nature of project, voltage levels, bundle configuration and so on, allow of an assumption that awarding the contract to the applicant in question will lead to a result that is:</P><P>— very good,</P><P>— good,</P><P>— satisfactory,</P><P>— adequate, or</P><P>— unsatisfactory.</P><P>If the applicant fulfils the suitability criteria (III.1.9), but is not allocated a slot in the testing institute commissioned by the contracting entity, it must follow the procedure described in part II.2.4.</P></METHODS></QUALIFICATION></LEFTI><PROCEDURE><LANGUAGES><LANGUAGE VALUE="EN"/></LANGUAGES></PROCEDURE><COMPLEMENTARY_INFO><INFO_ADD><P>Bid structure:</P><P>1) applicant questionnaire;</P><P>2) supporting documentation requested in the applicant questionnaire;</P><P>3) Lists of references;</P><P>4) statements of factors available via a third party or subcontractor, which the applicant is able to rely on as its own (“borrowed aptitude”);</P><P>5) particulars where a grouping of applicants is tendering:</P><P>— bids are to be written entirely in English,</P><P>— if an applicant cannot present a third party certificate, e.g. a register entry, as required, a comparable third party certificate must be presented and the comparability must be demonstrated by appropriate explanations,</P><P>— applicants outside Germany have to provide required explanations and evidence in English. Where, regarding a certain self-declaration or evidence, none can be supplied at all, the reason must be stated and an equivalent produced together with an explanation of why it is deemed of equivalent standing.</P><P>Each applicant that is a legally separate entity must tender its own bid. Bids are assessed solely on the basis of the tendering company. Bids from companies that are group-affiliated to other companies are considered only as tendered by that one company and in relation to the statements made in relation to it.</P><P>Applications as a group of applicants (called "AGs" in the following) are admissible. Applications submitted by AGs are to be accompanied by a fully completed AGs statement duly signed by authorised responsible signatories on behalf of each of their members. Particular attention must be paid to the aspect of the compliance of the formation of the AGs with cartel law. Each member of a AG requires to present the self-declaration and evidence required in terms of part III.1.9(a) to (c). AGs intending to apportion responsibilities among members are only subject to limited requirements in terms of part III.1.9(g) and (h), to the extent that, say, certain references can only be produced by one of the AG's members; in that case, the AG has to attach an appendix to its AG statement setting out a comprehensive justification of the limited extent to which self-declaration and evidence are furnished. AGs are otherwise subject to the same rules as all other applicants. Pre-qualification of AGs does not simultaneously entail pre-qualification of its individual members. Each member may apply for that separately and independently. In the event of a company being qualified both as an individual applicant and as a member of an AG, the contracting entity may require of it, prior to entering into negotiations, that its application has to be limited to one or the other form of participation.</P><P>Applicants can demonstrate their aptitude by citing that of other undertakings ("borrowed aptitude"). In such cases, the relevant applications is to be accompanied by a statement of commitment by that other undertaking, in which it states that, if the contract is let, it will perform certain tasks, which need to be clearly defined, for and on behalf of the applicant.</P></INFO_ADD><ADDRESS_REVIEW_BODY><OFFICIALNAME>Vergabekammer des Landes Berlin</OFFICIALNAME><ADDRESS>Martin-Luther-Straße 105</ADDRESS><TOWN>Berlin</TOWN><POSTAL_CODE>10825</POSTAL_CODE><COUNTRY VALUE="DE"/><PHONE>+49 3090138316</PHONE><E_MAIL>vergabekammer@senwtf.berlin.de</E_MAIL><FAX>+49 3090137613</FAX><URL>http://www.berlin.de/sen/wirtschaft/wirtschaft-und-technologie/wirtschaftsrecht/vergabekammer/</URL></ADDRESS_REVIEW_BODY><REVIEW_PROCEDURE><P>Deadlines for submitting an application for review stem from § 160 (3) of the German Act against Restraints of Competition.
